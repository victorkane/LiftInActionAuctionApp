LiftInActionAuctionApp
======================

Updated to work with Lift 2.5 and sbt 0.12


I am basically going through Timothy Perrett's book [Lift in Action](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/-/9781935182801) chapter by chapter, and following the example auction app, and attempting to get it to work with Lift 2.5 and sbt 0.12.

With the permission of the author, I am committing each Chapter into this public repo.

This repo is the src directory only.
